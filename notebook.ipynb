This is especially true for large datasets and complex filtering conditions.\n- **Optimizer benefits:** The PostgreSQL optimizer can potentially use the CTE's filtering information to create a more efficient execution plan.\n\n### Reasons filtering in main query might be better:\n\n- **Readability:** Filtering in the main query can sometimes lead to clearer code, especially for simple queries.\n- **Index utilization:** If the main query's WHERE clause uses columns with existing indexes, filtering there might leverage those indexes for faster
